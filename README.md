## 🚀 Overview

Introducing `rm-rs`, a revolutionary, memory-safe, blazingly fast implementation of the `rm` command! Written in pure, safe Rust! 

### 🔥 Key Features

- Blazingly Fast™ file removal capabilities
- Zero-cost abstractions for deleting files
- 100% Memory Safe!
- No unsafe code blocks!
- Fearless file deletion
- Built with Rust's world-class package manager, Cargo

## 🛠️ Installation 
```bash
cargo install rm-rs
```

## 📊 Benchmarks

| Command | Time | Memory Usage |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Original `rm` | 1ms | 1MB |
| `rm-rs` | 1ms + Rust runtime | 1MB + Rust runtime |

As you can see, we've achieved nearly identical performance to the original `rm` command, but now it's in Rust! 

## 🤔 Why rm-rs?

- Are you tired of using battle-tested Unix tools written in C?
- Do you believe everything should be rewritten in Rust?
- Do you enjoy adding unnecessary layers of abstraction?

Then `rm-rs` is perfect for you!

## 🔒 Security

Thanks to Rust's ownership model and strict compiler, we can guarantee that this wrapper around the system's `rm` command is absolutely memory safe*!

*Until it calls the actual `rm` command, but we don't talk about that part.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Rewrite it in Rust (oh wait, we already did that)
2. Add more unnecessary abstractions
3. Create more type-safe wrappers around system calls
4. Write "blazingly fast" at least three times in your PR description

Because that's what every Rust project does.

## 🎯 Future Roadmap

- Rewrite `ls` in Rust
- Rewrite `cd` in Rust
- Rewrite the entire GNU coreutils in Rust
- Rewrite the universe in Rust

Remember: If it ain't broke, rewrite it in Rust anyway! 🦀
